We reveal 3, and move 11 to the bottom. The deck is now [5,17,7,13,11]. We reveal 5, and move 17 to the bottom. The deck is now [7,13,11,17]. We reveal 7, and move 13 to the bottom. The deck is now [11,17,13]. We reveal 11, and move 17 to the bottom. The deck is now [13,17]. We reveal 13, and move 17 to the bottom. The deck is now [17]. We reveal 17.
